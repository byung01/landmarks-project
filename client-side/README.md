####Description
On the client side, a map is loaded with all the landmarks (__chickens__) within a one mile radius of the user's (__dancing lady__) current location and all of the other people (__chicks__) who have logged in before. All the pins on the map, when clicked on, will show an infowindow with the relevant information that is pulled from the server.
