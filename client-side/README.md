####Description
On the client side, a map (using the Google API) is loaded with all the landmarks (_chickens_) within a one mile radius of the user's (_dancing lady_) current location and all of the other people (_chicks_) who have logged in before. All the pins on the map, when clicked on, will show an infowindow with the relevant information that is pulled from the server.
